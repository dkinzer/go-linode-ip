#go-linonde-ip

This package adds the linode-ip executable that takes a match string and returns
the ipv4 address of a linode whose label matches the string.  If there is more
than one match then an interactive session is enabled that allows the user to
pick from a list of matches or to change the matching string.

The executable assumes that the `linode-cli` is available

## Installation

```bash
go  get github.com/dkinzer/go-linode-ip/cmd/linode-ip
```

## Usage

Example:

```
linode-ip traefik
```

Returns the ip address of the linode labeled  traefik.

Note that the matching string can be a regex.

If more than one match is found, then a session is opened allowing the user to choose between possible matches.

```
> linode-ip qa
Multiple matching linodes found:
-------------------------------
(0) cob-qa-solr-1
(1) qa-tupress-web
(2) ojs3-qa
(3) cob-qa-web
(4) manifold_qa
(5) funcake_qa
(6) aggregator_qa
(7) airflow_qa

[u] Update linode matcher
[e] exit
